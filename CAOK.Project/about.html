                Child Aid Organization Kenya (CAOK) is a registered non-governmental organization dedicated to creating lasting change in the lives of vulnerable children across Kenya and other developing countries. Since our inception, we have worked tirelessly to ensure that every child‚Äîregardless of background‚Äîhas access to basic needs, quality education, protection, and a brighter future.<br><br>

Our programs are designed to uplift disadvantaged communities by addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality, and poor educational outcomes.
